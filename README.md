# E-commerce A/B Testing and Funnel Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project performs an A/B test and funnel analysis on synthetic e-commerce data to evaluate the impact of two different landing page designs (Group A and Group B) on user conversion. The analysis aims to identify which design performs better in terms of overall conversion rate and to understand user behavior at each stage of the conversion funnel.

## Tools Used

*   Python
*   Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
*   SciPy/Statsmodels (for statistical hypothesis testing - two-proportion z-test)
*   Matplotlib (for data visualization)
*   Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab environment)

## Project Steps

1.  **Data Generation:** Synthetic e-commerce A/B testing data is generated, including user IDs, group assignments, conversion status, funnel stages, and timestamps. The data is designed with asymmetrical funnel progression probabilities between Group A and Group B to simulate a practical A/B test scenario.
2.  **Data Loading and Filtering:** The generated data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Converted users are filtered for initial examination.
3.  **A/B Testing (Two-Proportion Z-test):** A statistical hypothesis test is performed to compare the overall conversion rates between Group A and Group B and determine if the difference is statistically significant.
4.  **Funnel Analysis:** The number of unique users at each stage of the funnel is calculated for both groups. Conversion rates at each stage, relative to the initial landing page view, are also calculated.
5.  **Funnel Visualization:** The user progression through the funnel stages for each group is visualized using a grouped bar chart to allow for visual comparison.
6.  **Interpretation and Conclusion:** The results from the A/B test and funnel analysis are interpreted to draw conclusions about the performance of each landing page design and identify potential areas for optimization within the funnel.

## Analysis Summary

The analysis with the asymmetrical data revealed the following:

*   **A/B Test Result:** The two-proportion z-test showed a statistically significant difference in the overall conversion rates between Group A and Group B (p-value < 0.05).
*   **Funnel Analysis Insights:** The funnel analysis indicated that Group B had a higher overall conversion rate compared to Group A. The visualization and stage-by-stage user counts demonstrated that Group B was more effective at retaining users and guiding them through the various stages of the conversion funnel.

## Conclusion

Based on the A/B testing and funnel analysis with the asymmetrical data, it can be concluded that **Page Design B is statistically significantly better** than Page Design A in terms of achieving a higher overall conversion rate. The improved performance of Group B is attributed to better user retention throughout the conversion funnel.

## How to Run the Notebook

1.  Open the `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment (like Google Colab, JupyterLab, or Jupyter Notebook).
2.  Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.
3.  Examine the output of each cell, including the printed results and the visualizations.
4.  Interpret the A/B test results and funnel analysis to understand the project's findings.

## Files

*   `A/B_testing_and_funnel_analysis_for_E_commerce.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and analysis.
*   `ecommerce_ab_data.csv`: The synthetic data generated by the notebook.
